# ChickPeaOPT
## Abstract

## Steps of Analysis
1.	Data Acquisition:
  •	Identify relevant databases or literature sources for acquiring phenotype and genotype data for pea and chickpea.
  •	Extract phenotype data related to protein and yield traits for both crops.
  •	Obtain genotype data consisting of SNP markers from the selected sources.
  •	Ensure data integrity and quality during the acquisition process.
2.	Data Formatting:
  •	Convert genotype data into numeric format, Variant Call Format (VCF), HapMap format for specific analysis requirements.
  •	Provide detailed code for each formatting step, explaining the rationale behind the transformations and ensuring reproducibility.
3.	Data Visualization:
  •	Generate histograms and box plots to visualize the distribution of phenotype. 
  •	Create scatter plots to explore relationships between protein and yield traits.
  •	Use density map to visualize SNP data and identify patterns of genetic variation.
  •	Provide detailed code for each visualization technique, explaining how it aids in assessing data quality and identifying potential insights.
4.	SNP-based GWAS:
  •	Perform quality control on genotype data to filter out low-quality SNPs.
  •	Conduct association analysis between SNP markers and protein/yield traits using an appropriate statistical methods. 
  •	Interpret GWAS results to identify significant SNP-trait associations and potential candidate genes.
  •	Explain how these findings can inform marker-assisted selection in breeding programs and gene identification.
5.	SNP-based GS:
  •	Split data into training and validation sets for GS model development.
  •	Train a prediction model using SNP data and phenotype data.
  •	Evaluate model performance using cross-validation or independent validation datasets.
  •	Discuss the utility of GS for predicting protein and yield traits in breeding programs and its potential advantages over traditional methods.
6.	Haplotype-based GWAS:
  •	Construct haplotypes from genotype data using appropriate algorithms.
  •	Perform association analysis between haplotypes and protein/yield traits similar to SNP-based GWAS.
  •	Interpret results to identify haplotype-trait associations and their implications for breeding programs.
7.	Haplotype-based GS:
  •	Develop prediction models using haplotype data and phenotype data.
  •	Assess model accuracy and predictive power for protein and yield traits.
  •	Discuss the advantages of using haplotype-based GS in breeding programs compared to SNP-based GS.
8.	Multi-trait Genomic Prediction:
  •	Extend GS models to predict multiple traits simultaneously.
  •	Evaluate model performance for each trait individually and in combination.
  •	Explain how multi-trait genomic prediction can improve breeding efficiency by considering multiple traits simultaneously.
9.	Epistasis Analysis:
  •	Identify SNP-SNP interactions using appropriate statistical methods.
  •	Conduct epistasis analysis to identify pairs of SNPs that interact to influence protein and yield traits.
  •	Interpret results to understand the genetic basis of trait variation and its implications for breeding programs.
